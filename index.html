                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p><strong>Growing Up</strong></p>
                <p>I was born in Italy to Somali parents and grew up in the UK</p>
                <p>My hobbies included playing Volleyball where I volunteered at the Training Venue for the London 2012 Olympic Games, near the FAC offices at the Sobell Leisure Centre in Finsbury Park</p>
                <p><strong>University</strong></p>
                <p>I have a BSc in Business Management from King's College London and an MSc in Public Policy from UCL where I focused on behavioural economics</p>
                <p>That's where my passion for the psychology of personal finance began which was the seed to my start-up idea that led me to FAC</p>
                <p><strong>Career</strong></p>
                <p>After graduation, I began a career in investment banking at Citigroup where I spent 7 years</p>
                <p>Last October, I decided to make a change and reflected on what I wanted to do next</p>
                <p>I chose to pursue entreprenuership and follow my passion for personal finance</p>

                <h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
                <h3>3 motivations</h3>
                <div class="career_sub">
                    <p><strong>Pursue Entreprenuership</strong></p>
                    <p>My business idea is to use Open Banking technology to offer better financial planning to individuals</p>
                    <p>I want to dedicate time to train as a software developer before building an MVP as I feel it will be important for me to understand the technical aspects</p>
                </div>
                <div class="career_sub">
                    <p><strong>Meet Collaborators</strong></p>
                    <p>Learning to code alongside others will introduce me to future collaborators and people in similar stages in their entrepreneurial journeys</p>
                    <p>This is also so I can build my network within the technology industry</p>
                </div>
                <div class="career_sub">
                    <p><strong>Growth Opportunity</strong></p>
                    <p>One reason I had left my old job was to pursue growth</p>
                    <p>I want to take the time to learn for the sake of learning before diving into my next project</p>

                <h2>Why Founders and Coders</h2>
                <h3>3 reasons</h3>
                <div class="FAC_sub">
                    <p><strong>Community</strong></p>
                    <p>FAC welcomes and brings together individuals from different career backgrounds</p>
                    <p>At the coding meetups, I met previous mentors who have made the switch into technology having studied different subjects at university or pursued a different career</p>

                <div class="FAC_sub">
                    <p><strong>Pair-Programming</p></strong>
                    <p>The emphasis on peer-to-peer learning mirrors how people work together</p>
                    <p>I often used to discuss with my colleagues in abstract terms and later work in pairs to run analyses together in Excel</p>

                <div class="FAC_sub">
                    <p><strong>Dynamic Bootcamp</p></strong>
